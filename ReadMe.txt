Project Title: SharePic
Group Members: Rakshit Pithadia, Harsh Shah

Description: This is an iPhone app for sharing photos, where one can upload photos to multiple services (Dropbox, Flickr) in just one click. A person would create a profile with the services he wants, choose the photos and just say upload. This profile is also saved if the user wants to use it again in future.

The app does not have any errors, and is working on both our iPhones (5 and 6).
